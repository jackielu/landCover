=========================

12/2/2014  9 pm

Project updated to add data to map using D3 instead of Leaflet.  Next steps will be to:
1) clean up the code comments
2) pull and create the div button elements from the data
3) add interactivity

Prior leaflet based mapping code was saved into a file called script_leaflet.js

11/29 code, commited on 12/2/2014 8 pm - SHA bdf2dcfecd2b1537c8f86b5329c3b1668490827d

This is the first attempt at the landCover project using Leaflet to add polygons and styles to the map and the Skeleton boilerplate, with sidebar elements derived from the data that highlight polygons on the map with hover.  No D3 has been incorporated yet.
